# VBA-challenge

During this project, The VBA of Wall Street, we analyzed stock market data for three years (2018, 2019 and 2020) using VBA. I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol.

- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock.
