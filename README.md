# VBA-challenge

During this project, The VBA of Wall Street, we analyzed stock market data for three years (2018, 2019 and 2020) using VBA. I created a script that loops through all of the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol.

- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock.

I also added functionality to my script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

# VBA Scripts

This repository contains VBA scripts as separate files.

# Screenshots

In the Screenshots folder, screenshots for each year's results on the multi-year stock data can be found.
